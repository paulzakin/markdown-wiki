# Clean Slate security policy

## Supported versions

Markdown Wiki uses a **rolling release** model. This means only the most recent version of Markdown Wiki is supported.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, **do not create an issue** in GitHub. Instead, email `paul@cleanslate.sh`.

I'll draft [a GitHub security advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/repository-security-advisories/creating-a-repository-security-advisory). Then, I'll collaborate with you to get the patch released as quickly as possible.

Once, the patch is ready to go, we will:

- Bump the version of Markdown Wiki using SemVer. For example, `1.7.1` to `1.7.2`.
- Publish the security advisory to GitHub.
