# Markdown Wiki security policy

## Supported versions

Markdown Wiki uses a **rolling release** model. This means only the most recent version of Markdown Wiki is supported.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, **do not create an issue** in GitHub. Instead, email `contact@successible.net`. We will communicate with you to address the security vulnerability.

Once, the patch is ready to go, we will:

- Push the code to main and tag it for release.
- Add a disclosure to that version on [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/successible/markdown-wiki/releases).
